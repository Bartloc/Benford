Create a basic system description and document a normalized schema from the attached widgets text file.  
Include
 1) what you think this system would do 
 2) what you feel would be a reasonable database structure for the data and a reasonable architecture for the system 
 3) any questions or concerns you have regarding this dataset/system that might need to be answered before establishing 
    an ideal database/solution for such a system.

1. System is probably used for making/preparing orders from one end to another (warhouse > supplier > customer).
   It can used for checking what are current orders or what kind of orders are achievable.
   Can be used for ecommerce purposes (shops, warehouse apps etc.)

2. One data structure can be like that.

Architecture of system can be based on database structures, so we can define dictionares like:

suppliers, warehouses, clients, products etc. and then build widgets which allows to manipulate data
(f. example like orders etc).

3.

  a)  Question about price: 
	There are different prices for quantity of this same products (prices are not linear) for example
        5 pieces of Ant Trap cost 5 USD and 10 pieces cost 9 USD. Is there shall be some formula to add discount
        or price shall be added manually for user.

   b)  There is min_qty field probably for warehouse storage. What kind of indicator shall be presented when
       qty< min_qty?

   c) What kind of sorting/presenting/editing data shall be allowed for different types of users?

   d) What levels of users shall be added to system
